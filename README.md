ðŸ‡¬ Description
This project is a recursive configuration loader in Node.js that reads multiple JSON files (e.g., config.defaults.json, config.env.json, config.local.json) and merges them into a final configuration object.

It is designed to:

Read config files asynchronously.

Keep going even if some files are missing or unreadable.

Log which files were successfully loaded or failed.

Let later files override earlier ones.

config.env.json
